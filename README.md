# ML ZoomCamp Capstone Project

Hello guys, this repository contains the work carried out as a part of the Capstone Project for the course Machine Learning ZoomCamp. This course is organized and conducted by Mr. Alexey Grigorev.
This course is free of charge and can be learnt anytime.

## 1. Problem Description and Background
In today's world, Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are one of the most common causes of death.It is a class of diseases that involve the heart or blood vessels.Together CVD resulted in 17.9 million deaths (32.1%) in 2015, up from 12.3 million (25.8%) in 1990. Deaths, at a given age, from CVD are more common and have been increasing in much of the developing world, while rates have declined in most of the developed world since the 1970s. Coronary artery disease and stroke account for 80% of CVD deaths in males and 75% of CVD deaths in females. Most cardiovascular disease affects older adults. In the United States 11% of people between 20 and 40 have CVD, while 37% between 40 and 60, 71% of people between 60 and 80, and 85% of people over 80 have CVD. The average age of death from coronary artery disease in the developed world is around 80 while it is around 68 in the developing world. Diagnosis of disease typically occurs seven to ten years earlier in men as compared to women.
Amongst all types of CVDs, heart failure is one of the most common effect observed. 
Most cardiovascular diseases can be prevented by addressing behavioural risk factors such as tobacco use, unhealthy diet and obesity, physical inactivity and harmful use of alcohol using population-wide strategies.People with cardiovascular disease or who are at high cardiovascular risk (due to the presence of one or more risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidaemia or already established disease) need early detection and management wherein a machine learning model can be of great help.

- The [data](https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/heart-failure-clinical-data) that I have used contains 12 features that can be used to predict mortality by heart failure.
- This project is a binary classification problem.
- We will predict the Heart Failures using different models (our target variable being Death_Event).
- Target variable is the variable that is or should be the output. In our study our target variable is Death Event in the contex of determining whether anybody is likely to die due to heart failures based on the input parameters like gender, age and various test results or not.
- Lastly, we will build a variety of Classification models and compare the models giving the best prediction on Heart Failures.
